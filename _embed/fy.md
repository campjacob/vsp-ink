description: "We didn't do much for Spring Break, but the second weekend of break, we made an overnight trip to Seattle. While it was a short trip, it was jam-packed with time together, and I'm glad we got to go. We explored Seattle, ate good food, Belinda and I went out, and the next day, we went to the Zoo. There is no need to get into the story about driving out of our way to find food that could appease everybody's different wants, and how hangry people got."
