# General Office Hours

I created this website so that I could quickly and easily update my schedule and share it with anybody that might need to be in contact with me. I value being able to collaborate and work on problems in person. I go between several sites (e.g., Heritage at Toppenish/Kennewick campuses, Columbia Basin College Campus, and my home office). I try to adapt my location and schedule to meet the needs of a given week. The following is my general plan for locations:

- Tuesdays and Saturdays (when we have MSW classes) in Toppenish
- Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kennewick

I schedule specific times for collaboration and student meetings every week at 2 PM on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. I am at each site location during those times, and I also open up Zoom for anyone to join. You can join the Zoom meeting by visiting <https://heritage.zoom.us/my/dr.jacob>.

You can check out my [NOW](/now) page for my schedule this week/today. Feel free to email (campbell_j@heritage.edu) or call/text me at (509) 392-1056 to schedule a specific meeting time.
