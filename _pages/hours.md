# General Office Hours

I created this website so that I could quickly and easily update my schedule and share it with anybody that might need to be in contact with me. I value being able to collaborate and work on problems in person. I go between a number of different sites (e.g., Toppenish Campus, Kennewick Campus, Columbia Basin College Campus, and my home office). I try to adapt my location and schedule to meet the needs of a given week. The following is my general plan for locations:

- Tuesday's and Saturday's we have class in Toppenish
- Wednesday's and Thursday's in Kennewick

I schedule a specific times for collaboration and student meetings every week in both at 2 PM on Tuesday's and Wednesday's and try my best to hold that time available for anybody needing to meet. I am at each site location during those times, I also open up Zoom and anybody can drop in and connect as well. You can join by going to <https://heritage.zoom.us/my/dr.jacob>.

You can check out my [NOW](/now) page for what my schedule is this week/day. Feel free to email (campbell_j@heritage.edu) or call/text me (509) 392-1056 to schedule a specific time to meet.
