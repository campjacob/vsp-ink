# General Office Hours

I created this website so that I could quickly and easily update my schedule and share it with anybody who might need to be in contact with me. I value collaborating and working on problems in person. I go between several sites (e.g., Heritage at Toppenish/Kennewick campuses, Columbia Basin College Campus, and my home office). I adapt my location and schedule to meet the needs of a given week, so my schedule does vary depending on the needs for that week. The following is my general plan for locations:

- Tuesdays and Saturdays (when we have MSW classes) in Toppenish
- Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kennewick

I schedule specific times for collaboration and student meetings every week, at 2 p.m. on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. When this time must be changed, I move it so there is always a scheduled time each week. During my scheduled office hours at each site, I'm open for people to come by in person or join Zoom (<https://heritage.zoom.us/my/dr.jacob>).

You can check out my [NOW](/now) page for my schedule this week and today. To schedule a specific meeting time, feel free to email me (campbell_j@heritage.edu) or call/text me at (509) 392-1056.

I attempt to maintain an open door policy, meaning days I'm on campus you can also come by my office and meet as needed. My offices are as follows:

**Toppenish Campus**: Simpkins Hall in Office 2126  
**Tri-Cities Campus in Kennewick**: Office 4209
