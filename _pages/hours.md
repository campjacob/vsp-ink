# General Office Hours

I created this website so I could quickly and easily update my schedule and share it with anyone who might need to contact me. I value collaborating and working on problems in person. I go between several sites (e.g., Heritage at Toppenish/Kennewick campuses, Columbia Basin College Campus, and my home office). I adapt my location and schedule to meet the needs of each week, so my schedule varies accordingly. The following is my general plan for spring 2026 based on locations:

- Tuesdays and Saturdays (when we have MSW classes) in Toppenish
- Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kennewick
- Monday and Wednesday Evenings at CBC Campus

I schedule specific times for collaboration with students or other professionals every week, with an open office hour at my two main sites. These times are subject to change, so please check my [NOW](/now) page for my schedule this week and today. Weekly drop-in sessions are available via [Zoom](https://heritage.zoom.us/my/dr.jacob) or in-person.
