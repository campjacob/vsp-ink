# General Office Hours

I created this website so that I could quickly and easily update my schedule and share it with anybody who might need to be in contact with me. I value collaborating and working on problems in person. I go between several sites (e.g., Heritage at Toppenish/Kennewick campuses, Columbia Basin College Campus, and my home office). I adapt my location and schedule to meet the needs of a given week, so my schedule does vary depending on the needs for that week. The following is my general plan for locations:

- Tuesdays and Saturdays (when we have MSW classes) in Toppenish
- Wednesdays and Thursdays in Kennewick

I schedule specific times for collaboration and with students or other professionals every week with an opn office hour at my two main sites. These times are sometimes subject to change so make sure to check out my [NOW](/now) page for my schedule this week and today. Weekly drop-in sessions are available via [Zoom](https://heritage.zoom.us/my/dr.jacob) or in-person.
