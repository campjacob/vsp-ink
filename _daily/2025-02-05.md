I'm at the Kennewick campus today despite the snow (although I did take the bus this morning). I am still working on class work prep for SOWK 587 have some collaborative meetings, and teach sowk 487 tonight at CBC.

This is just a reminder about the snow. I hold classes in person if the campus is not closed. Let me know if you can't come. The session will be recorded and able to be viewed after. You can see information about [CBC's Inclement Weather](https://www.columbiabasin.edu/live/stay/campus-security-and-safety/inclement-weather.html) for evening classes. They determine if they will close for evening classes by 3:30 PM.
