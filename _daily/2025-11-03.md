Today I have a couple of meetings that made the most sense to come in person. I am preparing for a training I'm facilitating with high school students and introducing them to what social work education looks like. I will also be preparing for week 11 and the content to share for all my classes.

**Schedule 11/03/25**

- 12:00 PM **Town Hall Meeting: Dr. Gilmer** Campus - Patricia Wade
- 2:00 PM **Counseling Center Dreaming/Scheming** Campus - RAU
