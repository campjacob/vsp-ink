I'm on a committee to evaluate faculty portfolios and am working on my evaluation today in between meetings.

Over the weekend I went to Olympia for the NASW WA chapter for their policy conference. You can see their [post about it](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1FQZHPxceu/) and a group photo. 

You can see photos I posted at [Olympia during the 50501 protest](https://media.vsp.ink/i/web/post/797346277070581903) going on there.
