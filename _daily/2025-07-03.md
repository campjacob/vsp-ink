I'm working from home today. I'm also not feeling super well, and might be getting a bit of a summer cold. I have a couple of Zoom meetings and want to make progress on grading and preparing my grading form for students' policy papers.

**Schedule 07/03/25**

- 2:00 PM **Heritage University MSW proposal**
- 3:00 PM **MSW Admissions Committee Reviews**
