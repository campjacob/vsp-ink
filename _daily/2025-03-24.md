I am flying in this afternoon from my spring break. I left on Sunday at 6 AM and will arrive at about noon today (e.g., Monday), so it has been a long travel day. I won't be able to do much work other than finalize my plans for my class tonight and start unpacking. You can see some of the posts that I wrote about my trip.
