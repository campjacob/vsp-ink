**Schedule 04/23/25**

I'm not sure. I had planned to be at the Kennewick campus, but have been called in to do jury duty. I should still be able to facilitate class in the evening.

I ended up finishing earlier than expected. I don't know if I will be asked to return tomorrow/this week. If I am, I will likely be in trial next week. I am back at Kennewick and will have my office hour at 2pm. Otherwise I am working on grading.
