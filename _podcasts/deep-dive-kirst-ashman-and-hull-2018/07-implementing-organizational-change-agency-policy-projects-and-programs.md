This episode explores Chapter 7, “Implementing Organizational Change: Agency Policy, Projects, and Programs,” which details the practical execution of macro-level interventions within a social service setting. We begin by conceptualizing the macro-practice environment, specifically identifying the macro client, change agent, target, and action systems required to achieve organizational goals. The discussion outlines a seven-step process for change, starting with an innovative idea and moving through mustering support, identifying assets, and specifying measurable goals and action steps. We also introduce essential planning tools like PERT charts to map task sequences and time frames, while offering strategies to neutralize opposition and evaluate outcomes. Finally, we examine how to use the macro-change process to establish culturally competent and empowering organizations that effectively respond to the needs of diverse populations.
