Chapters 3 and 4 move from the theoretical foundations of generalist practice to the practical application of interpersonal and group-level skills within macro environments. Chapter 3 underscores the necessity of micro skills, such as empathy, attentive listening, and nonverbal sensitivity, as the building blocks for navigating professional interactions with supervisors and community stakeholders. It also emphasizes assertiveness as a vital mechanism for empowerment, allowing social workers to uphold their professional rights and those of their clients without resorting to aggression. Chapter 4 builds upon these foundations by detailing group skills, including leadership strategies designed to inspire others and lead by example during the change process. This chapter further examines the role of networking for mutual aid and the development of effective teams characterized by clear goals and collaborative climates. Finally, it offers practical tools for conducting meetings via parliamentary procedure and a comprehensive seven-step model for conflict management, enabling practitioners to resolve disputes through communication and cooperation.
