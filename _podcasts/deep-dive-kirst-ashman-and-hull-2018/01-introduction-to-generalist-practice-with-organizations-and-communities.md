Chapter 1 introduces generalist practice as the integrated application of an eclectic knowledge base, professional values, and a wide range of skills used to target systems of any size for change. Central to this approach is the Generalist Intervention Model (GIM), which utilizes a seven-step planned change process consisting of engagement, assessment, planning, implementation, evaluation, termination, and follow-up. The chapter emphasizes that practitioners must be proficient across micro (individuals), mezzo (small groups), and macro (organizations and communities) systems, while remaining grounded in core principles such as client empowerment, human diversity, and the pursuit of social, economic, and environmental justice. By assuming diverse professional roles—such as advocate, mediator, and mobilizer—and applying critical thinking to scrutinize assumptions and avoid fallacies, generalist social workers are prepared to navigate organizational structures and improve service delivery for large populations. This foundational overview illustrates why understanding larger systems is essential for every social worker, regardless of whether they primarily work with individuals or families.
